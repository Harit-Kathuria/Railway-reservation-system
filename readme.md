# Project: Railway Reservation System in C++
## About:
This project is for booking train tickets just like a regular ticket booking software.<br/>
It also contains the employee side to add the trains between two destinations with specified date and time. <br/>
User can securely login through its user id and password. <br/>
It also has a payment interface where a person can pay and get its train seat reserved.<br/>
I used the concept of file handling for this project.<br/>
I am attaching some dat files (generated by this program) so that one can see the data in it.<br/>
I used binary files to make the credentials little secure.<br/>
Since its only a prototype there is no linking with any database.
