Project: Railway Reservation System in C++
About:
This project is for booking train tickets just like a regular ticket booking software.
It also contains the employee side to add the trains between two destinations with specified date and time. 
User can securely login through its user id and password. 
It also has a payment interface where a person can pay and get its train seat reserved.
I used the concept of file handling for this project.
I am attaching some dat files (generated by this program) so that one can see the data in it.
I used binary files to make the credentials little secure.
Since its only a prototype there is no linking with any database.
